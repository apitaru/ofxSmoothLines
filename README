Detailed information on this coming soon. 

Basically: 

iOS devices don't allow us to draw antialiased (smooth) lines easily. 

I came across this amazing method to 'fake' the smoothness here - http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1669-how-to-render-anti-aliased-lines-with-textures-in-ios-4/

One of its benefits over other methods is that it is relatively easy on the cpu and doesn't harm your fps too as much.

At the moment this is just an initial commit with proof-of-concept. I'll steadily make this into a nice API in the following weeks.
